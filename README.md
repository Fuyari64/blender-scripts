# Find Conflicting Bones
The purpose of this script is to show on console the conflicting bones of a GldSrc model, specifically for Sven Coop. During model porting it's very common to accidentally assign vertices to multiple bones by accident which is not allowed by the engine. Then frustration ensues to find which bones even have that problem, this script should display that.
